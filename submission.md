<h3>Scope</h3>
Fault Tolerance is a cross-cutting issue that spans all layers of the hardware/software stack, and hence, requires coupled improvements in each layer and co-design between the different layers. FTS aims at providing a venue for researchers to share experiences across the hardware/software layers and attendees to get a holistic view of fault tolerance techniques, especially with a focus on HPC and parallel computing.

<h3>Topics Of Interest</h3>
The focus areas for this workshop include, but are not limited to:

- [Techniques for predicting, detecting, and correcting silent data corruption](#scope1)
- [Hardware failure prediction and recovery techniques](#scope2)
- [Novel hardware design for fault mitigation](#scope3)
- [Programming interfaces and libraries to facilitate resilience](#scope4)
- [Resilient algorithm design for application level fault tolerance](#scope5)
- [Failure modeling and analysis](#scope6)
- [Checkpoint/restart model and replication model](#scope7)
- [Fault injection techniques for improved tool development](#scope8)
- [Hardware and software fault detection and reporting systems](#scope9)
- [Fault tolerance for coupled executions, workflows, and in situ data analytics](#scope10)
- [Algorithms for performance optimization in the presence of faults](#scope11)
- [Techniques and algorithms for rollback recovery](#scope12)

<h3>Proceedings</h3>
Proceedings of this workshop will be published in CD format and will be available at the conference (together with the IEEE Cluster conference proceedings). The accepted papers will be included in and indexed by the IEEE CS digital library.

<h3>Submission Instructions</h3>
Camera-ready version of accepted papers must be compliant with the IEEE Xplore format for publication. Submissions must be in PDF format and they should not exceed 8 pages (All inclusive). Authors with accepted papers may purchase additional up to 2 pages. Submissions must be single-spaced, 2-column numbered pages (8.5x11-inch paper, margins in inches -- top: 0.75, bottom: 1.0, sides:0.625, and between columns:0.25, main text: 10pt). Submissions are NOT double-blind. Author information should be included on the submission and will be visible to the reviewers. LaTeX and Word Templates are available [here](http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html){:target="_blank"}. Only web-based submissions are allowed. Please submit your paper via the submission system. Submissions will be judged based on relevance, significance, originality, correctness and clarity.
