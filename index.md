FTS 2017 is the 3th edition of the FTS workshop series, organized in conjunction with the 2017
IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (Cluster 2017).


Fault Tolerance is a cross-cutting issue that spans all layers of the hardware/software stack, 
and hence, requires coupled improvements in each layer and co-design between the different layers. 
FTS aims at providing a venue for researchers to share experiences across the hardware/software 
layers and attendees to get a holistic view of fault tolerance techniques, especially with a 
focus on HPC and parallel computing.
